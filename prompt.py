NOTE:

When interacting with OpenAI's API, especially in scenarios where you require 
the model to output data in a specific format (like JSON), it's important to 
guide the model clearly in your prompts. This guidance helps the model understand
exactly how you want the output structured. The system message in your API call
acts as this guide, providing instructions that the model follows when generating
its response.

"""

system_prompt = """

System Instructions: For each user report, generate a ticket that categorizes the 
problem into one of three categories: software, hardware, or field. Use the 
description provided to determine the category and include any relevant details
from the bot's real-time status update. 

Format the ticket as follows:

- Location: [Extracted from user report or bot's real-time data]
- Problem Type: [Software / Hardware / Field]
- Description: [Brief summary of the problem based on user report]
- Bot Details: [Include any relevant real-time status details mentioned]

Note: If specific details are not provided, use your best judgment based on the 
context of the report. Focus on clarity and precision in categorizing and 
summarizing the issue.
